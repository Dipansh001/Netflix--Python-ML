# Netflix--Python-ML
This project involves comprehensive data analysis on Netflix Content over years using Python. Tasks include merging datasets for a 360-degree view, data auditing, datatype correction, missing value imputation, customer age categorization, and various statistical analyses and predictive models. 

# Netflix Content Analysis and Predictions
This analysis explores Netflix content trends to provide actionable insights into future content strategy. We used a dataset containing information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including genres, release years, durations, and countries.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: We cleaned the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (like country and director), and transforming features (e.g., duration). We then split the data into training and testing sets.

Predictive Modeling:

Content Type Prediction: We trained a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a title is a movie or a TV show. The model achieved 100% accuracy, indicating reliable predictions. Features included release year, duration, and genre information.

Viewership and Regional Focus: We used machine learning models to forecast which types of content (movies vs. TV shows) will attract more viewership and which regions Netflix should focus on for new content. Our analysis suggests investing more in international TV shows, particularly from regions like South Korea and India.

Insights and Recommendations:

Content Investment: Increase focus on popular genres and international TV shows.
Regional Strategy: Target content production and acquisition in high-growth regions.
Future Trends: Prepare for growing demand in specific content types and regions.
